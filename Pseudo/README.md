## Pseudopotentials

The pseudopotential files in this folder are soft, typically norm-conserving ones, chosen to allow the tutorials to be run quickly. They are not meant for production (publication) runs. Remember to test all pseudopotentials before use.

Here is an incomplete list of pseudopotential libraries for QE (UPF format):
