# Design a molecule from scratch
In this tutorial we will use Avogadro2 to create the pyrrole molecule, relax the structure with a force-field optimization, and then perform an accurate geometry optimization using quantum-ESPRESSO.

The below tutorial works with the second version of Avogadro, at https://two.avogadro.cc/

**If you are using the original version of Avogadro (at https://avogadro.cc/), which has slightly different menus, follow instead [this tutorial for Avogadro](README.md)**
