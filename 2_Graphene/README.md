# Graphene (2_Graphene)
In this tutorial we show how to perform calculations for (1) metallic/semi-metallic systems, a (2) low-dimensional (2D) system, and (3) a spin-polarized system.

## Running the exercise
  Enter each sub-directory in numerical order, and follow the detailed instructions in each README file.
  - [0_cutoff](0_cutoff)
    - View an input file for a supercell and visualize it using xcrysden. 
    - Determine the convergence with respect to the kinetic energy cutoff
  - [1_ksmear](1_ksmear)
    - Determine the convergence with respect to the k-point mesh and smearing
  - [2_vacuum](2_vacuum)
    - Test convergence with respect to the cell size/vacuum spacing.
  - [3_alat](3_alat)
    - Determine the theoretical lattice parameter
  - [4_bands](4_bands)
    - Compute the band structure
  - [5_DOS](5_DOS)
    - Compute the density of states.
  - [6_projected_DOS](6_projected_DOS)
    - Project the DOS onto atomic orbitals.
  - [7_projected_bands](7_projected_bands)
    - Analyse the band structure in terms of atomic orbitals
