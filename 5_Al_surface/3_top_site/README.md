# Adsorption of O on Al(001): general strategies

Here we will compute the adsorption energy of an O atom on the Ag(001) surface.

When considering adsorption of oxygen, it is more common to compute the oxygen atom energy from that of the O2 molecule, since adsorption usually involved the molecular species.

Surface optimizations are slow calculations so it is important to identify a good strategy.



## Input file

We will start from the relaxed coordinates of the Al(001) surface. 
We add by hand an O atom in a chosen site. For simplicity, we will start with the on-top site.

Our choice of a (3x3) surface unit cell determines the coverage: we will let the O atom occupy only 1 of  9 possible sites, hence the coverage is 1/9 = 0.11 ML (monolayer). This value is relevant if we wish to compare with experimental adsorption or work function measurement. Here we are using a (3x3) cell for illustrative purposes only.

How high do we put the O atom? It is important to have a reasonable starting geometry - as close as possible to the final result! - otherwise the optimization can take a long time.
Hence we need an estimate of the Al-O bond distance. Looking at the literature, e.g. a study of Al2O3 [1], we estimate a range of 1.70-2.10A, depending on the coordination. 

Let's start then with an Al-O distance of 1.72A.
Recall `alat=2.8546`, thus we place the O atom about 0.61 alat units above an Al atom in the top layer.

Besides that, note that we take the same cutoff as oxygen - i.e., the largest cutoff of O (40Ry) or Al (20Ry), and the smearing chosen for Al(001).
We are now ready to compute the relaxed geometry.

### Convergence with k-points

- While gamma and 221110 both use a single k-point, the gamma_only choice is significantly poorer. It would be better to run a first rough relaxation with 221110, and restart from there.
- Convergence is achieved for a 661110 grid (6 k-points)
- Hollow site is significantly more favoured over top site.
- The absolute value of E_ads varies a lot depending on the treatment of spin in the single atom.
- Take care when comparing with other works, for example 3.3 eV is reported for hollow site adsorption in [2]. Discrepancies arise in many places: spin, number of slab layers, pseudopotential, etc.
